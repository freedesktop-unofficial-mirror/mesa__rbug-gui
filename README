                    GALLIUM REMOTE DEBUGGING GUI

= About =

This is the gui interface to the Gallium Remote Debugger.
It is written in C and uses gtk, gtkglext and Gallium.


For information about protocol (de)marshaling see:
$(MESA)src/gallium/auxiliary/rbug/README

for information about driver integration look in:
$(MESA)src/gallium/drivers/trace/README

for information about applications look in:
$(MESA)progs/rbug/README


= Building =

You need to have checked out a mesa repository in a sibling directory to this
directory called mesa, as currently the build looks for mesa in ../mesa/.
You also need to build a debug build of mesa with with gallium so that the
needed libraries excist:

	$(MESA)src/gallium/auxiliary/rbug/librbug.a
	$(MESA)src/gallium/auxiliary/tgsi/libtgsi.a
	$(MESA)src/gallium/auxiliary/util/libutil.a


The gtk dependancies should be satisfied on debian based system with:

sudo apt-get install libgtk2.0-dev libgtkglext1-dev


Then just do:
 ./autogen.sh
 make


= Usage =

Make sure that you driver has trace integration, see above. Then from on
the computer that you want to debug do:

 export GALLIUM_RBUG=true

 <launch app>

From the debugging computer launch rbug-gui from this folder.

./rbug-gui [ip|hostname]

If no ip/hostname is give rbug-gui will ask you for a ip and port. You can
also call "make run" which will connect automaticaly to localhost.
